```

If you want to install the dev versions (or access packages that haven't been released on CRAN), run `usethis::edit_r_profile()` to edit your `.Rprofile`. Then write in:

```
options(repos=structure(c(
  FHI="https://folkehelseinstituttet.github.io/drat/",
  CRAN="https://cran.rstudio.com"
)))
```

Save the file and restart R. This will allow you to install the following packages from the FHI registry.

If you are an employee at FHI and would like to include your package in this repository, please contact RichardAubrey.White@fhi.no


```{r, results='asis'}
huxtable::print_html(get_package_table(
  drat_repo = params$drat_repo,
  win_version = params$win_version
))
